This is a self-contained, "portable" version of the Matlab files. It will create
the folder structure for the Matlab-functions itself. 
Just run the script 'Shell.m' after adding the folder 'Waitbar' to the path. 
It is important to have the Matlab search path pointing to this folder for the 
script to create new folders in the same directory.
